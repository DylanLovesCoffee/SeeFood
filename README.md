# Omakase
"I'll leave it up to you."

Omakase is an app that allows you to take a photo of your groceries and tells you what recipes you can make out of them.

## Introduction
I've discontinued working on this repo and transitioned to building the app out under a different name and repo [here](https://github.com/DylanLovesCoffee/forage).

## Built With
- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
